🏆 EduCare AI: Your Proactive Student Success Co-pilot
EduCare AI is a serverless, AI-powered dashboard that transforms raw student data into actionable insights, enabling educators to identify and support at-risk students before they fall behind.

In an era of data overload, educators are often forced to be reactive. We built EduCare AI to make them proactive.

🚀 The "Wow" Factor: What Impressed Us
Serverless, Browser-First Architecture: This entire application is a single HTML file. There is no backend, no server costs, and no complex setup. It's infinitely scalable and 100% private, as all data is processed and stored locally in the user's browser.

AI-Powered Insight Engine: We didn't just connect to an API. We implemented dynamic prompt engineering that feeds contextual student data to the Google Gemini API, turning it from a generic chatbot into a specialized educational analyst that can answer complex, data-specific questions.

Hyper-Interactive Canvas Heatmap: Instead of a static image or a clunky library, we built a custom-rendered risk heatmap using the HTML5 Canvas API. It's lightweight, incredibly fast, and provides an immediate, data-dense overview of the entire class's well-being.

🎯 The Problem: Why This Matters
Educators are drowning in spreadsheets. Critical warning signs—a slight drop in attendance, a dip in test scores, a pending fee—are often scattered and disconnected. By the time these trends are manually identified, it's often too late for effective intervention. This leads to higher dropout rates and unrealized student potential.

💡 Our Solution: From Reactive to Proactive
EduCare AI solves this by creating a single source of truth that is not just a display, but an analytical partner.

Automated Risk Detection: Our custom algorithm instantly analyzes multiple vectors (attendance, performance trends, fee status, etc.) to generate a real-time risk score.

Visual Clarity: We don't just show tables. We use Chart.js and our custom Canvas heatmap to make complex data instantly understandable.

Actionable AI Guidance: The integrated Gemini AI Mentor doesn't just answer questions; it provides concrete, evidence-based intervention strategies, acting as a co-pilot for the educator.

🛠️ Technical Showcase & Features
Instant Data Onboarding: Seamlessly upload .xlsx or .csv files using XLSX.js (SheetJS).

Dynamic Visualizations: All charts are dynamically generated with Chart.js and update in real-time based on filters and data changes.

Zero-Dependency Execution: Runs out-of-the-box in any modern browser with no installation or build steps required.

Modern UI/UX: A clean, fully responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS.

100% Client-Side Logic: All calculations, data processing, and state management are handled efficiently with Vanilla JavaScript.
